# CDJ Project: Economics/Public Policy, Social Security

CDJ Social Security Project (Economics/Public Policy)

## Purpose of Project: 
To analyze current ongoing social security insolvency crisis and help readers understand the issue. Since this issue impacts all u.s. citizens, it is something that is worth analyzing. 

Installation instructions: 
For the socialsecurity_3dchloropleth_effectofcrisis.ipynb file, import the geoconda environment using the geoconda.yaml file. Then run jupyter notebook and run the file. 

## Instruction for reproduction:
All source code, data, and figures are contained in the **/CDJ/Social_Security/For_WebDev_Editorial** folder for convinience.

On the google doc with our draft, each figure has a google doc comment with the **file path** of the file (ipynb) to reproduce that figure. For each code file, check code comments for the stpes.


## Additional Notes 
- Current figure colors and styles are PLACEHOLDERS. Please, standardize Colors and Chart Styles of all plots. WebDev/Editorial can choose the color palette and style to use. Potentially something similar to NYT data visualization styles. 

- Standardize title styles, x-y label styles, xticks, yticks as fit
