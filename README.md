# CDJ Project: Economics/Public Policy, Social Security

CDJ Social Security Project (Economics/Public Policy)

## Purpose of Project: 
To analyze current ongoing social security insolvency crisis and help readers understand the issue. Since this issue impacts all u.s. citizens, it is something that is worth analyzing. 

Installation instructions: 
For the socialsecurity_3dchloropleth_effectofcrisis.ipynb file, import the geoconda environment using the geoconda.yaml file. Then run jupyter notebook and run the file. 
To generate the different maps by agi stub, change the tax bracket variable and the monetary range variable.  Here's a table of the revenues with the matching agi stub:
| Stub | Range           |
|------|-----------------------------|
| 2    | $1 under $10,000            |
| 3    | $10,000 under $25,000       |
| 4    | $25,000 under $50,000       |
| 5    | $50,000 under $75,000       |
| 6    | $75,000 under $100,000      |
| 7    | $100,000 under $200,000     |
| 8    | $200,000 under $500,000     |

## Instruction for reproduction:
All source code, data, and figures are contained in the **/CDJ/Social_Security/For_WebDev_Editorial** folder for convinience.

On the google doc with our draft, each figure has a google doc comment with the **file path** of the file (ipynb) to reproduce that figure. For each code file, check code comments for the stpes.


## Additional Notes 
- Current figure colors and styles are PLACEHOLDERS. Please, standardize Colors and Chart Styles of all plots. WebDev/Editorial can choose the color palette and style to use. Potentially something similar to NYT data visualization styles. 

- Standardize title styles, x-y label styles, xticks, yticks as fit
